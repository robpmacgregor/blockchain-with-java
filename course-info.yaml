title: Blockchain with Java
language: English
summary: "<div><div class=\"alert alert-primary\">You will practice concepts frequently\
  \ tested in technical interviews at top tech companies.</div>\r\n<p>Blockchains\
  \ are data structures where blocks are inseparably connected. What makes blockchains\
  \ so special is the security level they offer due to the way they are constructed.\
  \ Blockchains are unhackable, so it makes perfect sense why cryptocurrency makes\
  \ use of this technology. In this project, you will try yourself at making a microcosm\
  \ where virtual miners earn cryptocurrency and exchange messages and transactions\
  \ using blockchain. As difficult as the project might be, it is bound to pay off:\
  \ not in cryptocurrency, but in knowledge and skills.</p></div>"
