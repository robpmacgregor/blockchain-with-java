<p>Sometimes you need to take a snapshot of the state of an object to implement an undo or rollback mechanism. It can be useful if you are working on a text, a graphical editor, or a turn-based game.</p>
<p>Generally, objects encapsulate their internal state to make it inaccessible from the outside, which means you cannot just copy the values of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/16528" target="_blank" title="In Java, a private field is a field that is declared with the access modifier 'private', which restricts access to that field to the class in which it is declared. | This means that other classes, even if they are in the same package, cannot directly access or modify the private field of the class. By using the private access modifier, you can encapsulate the implementation details of a class and provide a controlled interface for other classes to interact with it. Private fields are typically not exposed directly to other classes. Instead, they are made accessible through accessor methods, also known as getter and setter methods. These methods provide encapsulation, which allows you to hide implementation details and control data access, ensuring security. According to the data encapsulation principle, the field of a class should not be directly accessed from other classes. Instead, the field can be accessed only through the methods of that particular class. To access a hidden field, programmers write special types of methods called getters and setters. Getters can only read the field, and setters can only write to the field. For example, a class may have four fields, each of which is declared as private to hide the field from direct access from other classes. The class may also have public getters and setters for accessing the fields through these methods.">private fields</a> of an object and save them externally. To solve the task and avoid this and some other potential problems, there is a design pattern called <strong>Memento</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="memento">Memento</h5>
<p>Memento is one of the classic <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/16528" target="_blank" title="In Java, a behavioral pattern is a design pattern that is concerned with the interaction between objects. | There are about 12 design patterns that belong to this category, with the command pattern being one of the most commonly used. The purpose of the command pattern is to decouple the logic between a command and its consumer. It encapsulates all the data related to a command in one object, which typically consists of a set of methods, their parameters, and one or more objects that these methods belong to. This decoupling allows for flexibility, as changing a command does not affect its consumer. Other behavioral patterns include the state pattern, which is useful when the behavior of a class depends on its current state and changes during runtime.">behavioral patterns</a> and it is intended to facilitate saving and restoring the state of an object without breaking the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/16528" target="_blank" title="In Java, encapsulation is the practice of wrapping data and the methods that manipulate that data within a single unit, typically a class. | This allows for increased security and control over the data, as well as a more organized code structure.

This pattern introduces three objects, the <strong>Originator</strong>, the <strong>Caretaker, </strong>and the <strong>Memento</strong>,<strong> </strong>as shown in the diagram below, each of which is responsible for performing a specific task.</p>
<p><picture><img alt="diagram of the Memento pattern" height="434" src="https://ucarecdn.com/2e63f5a9-c81d-49b4-bda5-778aeac7966d/" width="1474"/></picture></p>
<p>According to this diagram, the Originator is the object whose state, represented by a number of private fields, is to be saved. The Originator can take snapshots of its state and save them to special objects named Mementos. It can also restore its previous state from a provided Memento.</p>
<p>The Memento is a data object that contains a snapshot of the Originator's state. It does not expose the saved state so that no other object except for the Originator can access it. In addition, the fields of the Memento may be immutable which prevents the saved state from being accidentally modified.</p>
<p>The Caretaker is an object responsible for calling the respective methods of the Originator to create Mementos and to restore the Originator's state from a saved snapshot. The Caretaker may also keep a history of the Originator's state changes as a collection of Memento objects.</p>
<p>As you can see, the state of the Originator remains encapsulated and the internal logic of the Originator is simplified since it does not have to decide how and when to save and restore its state. A drawback of such an approach is high memory consumption in cases when the Originator has to create big Mementos to save its state and the Caretaker has to keep a long history of the Originator's state changes.</p>
<h5 id="implementation">Implementation</h5>
<p>Let's see how to implement the Memento pattern in practice. Let's create a simple text editor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Editor {
    private String text = "";
    private int textSize = 12;
    private int textColor = 0x000000;

    public void setText(String text) {
        this.text = text;
    }

    public void setTextSize(int textSize) {
        this.textSize = textSize;
    }

    public void setTextColor(int textColor) {
        this.textColor = textColor;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Editor{" +
                "text='" + text + '\'' +
                ", textSize=" + textSize +
                ", textColor=" + String.format("0x%06X", textColor) +
                '}';
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>With our editor, we can change the text, as well as the text size and color. Also, we can peek at the state of the editor using the overridden <code class="language-java">toString</code> method. The <code class="language-java">Editor</code> class will be our Originator.</p>
<p>Next, we need to create a class that will serve as a Memento. Let's call it <code class="language-java">EditorState</code>. To preserve encapsulation, we can make it a nested static class inside the <code class="language-java">Editor</code> class and make its fields and constructor private so that only <code class="language-java">Editor</code> can access them. Also, we have to add the required methods to the <code class="language-java">Editor</code> class to be able to create snapshots and restore its state.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Editor {
    private String text = "";
    private int textSize = 12;
    private int textColor = 0x000000;

    public void setText(String text) { this.text = text; }

    public void setTextSize(int textSize) { this.textSize = textSize; }

    public void setTextColor(int textColor) { this.textColor = textColor; }

    @Override
    public String toString() {...}

    public EditorState getState() {
        return new EditorState(text, textSize, textColor);
    }

    public void setState(EditorState state) {
        this.text = state.text;
        this.textSize = state.textSize;
        this.textColor = state.textColor;
    }

    static class EditorState {
        private final String text;
        private final int textSize;
        private final int textColor;

        private EditorState(String text, int textSize, int textColor) {
            this.text = text;
            this.textSize = textSize;
            this.textColor = textColor;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>As the next step, let's create a class that will act as the Caretaker:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.ArrayDeque;
import java.util.Deque;

class EditorHistory {
    private final Editor editor;
    private final Deque&lt;Editor.EditorState&gt; history = new ArrayDeque&lt;&gt;();

    EditorHistory(Editor editor) {
        this.editor = editor;
    }

    public void save() {
        history.push(editor.getState());
    }

    public void undo() {
        if (!history.isEmpty()) {
            editor.setState(history.pop());
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>It has a reference to our <code class="language-java">Editor</code> class, a collection of <code class="language-java">EditorState</code> objects and two methods: <code class="language-java">save</code> and <code class="language-java">undo</code>, to manipulate the state of <code class="language-java">Editor</code>.</p>
<h5 id="running-the-code">Running the code</h5>
<p>Now it's time to test our code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Editor editor = new Editor();
        EditorHistory history = new EditorHistory(editor);

        history.save();
        editor.setText("Hello, world!");

        history.save();
        editor.setTextSize(24);

        history.save();
        editor.setTextColor(0x00FF00);

        System.out.println(editor);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>We created instances of <code class="language-java">Editor</code> and <code class="language-java">EditorHistory</code> and made a series of changes to the state of <code class="language-java">editor</code>, saving a snapshot of it before each change. If we run this code, we will get the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Editor{text='Hello, world!', textSize=24, textColor=0x00FF00}</code></pre>
<p>Now let's try to undo the changes step by step:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">history.undo();
System.out.println(editor);

history.undo();
System.out.println(editor);

history.undo();
System.out.println(editor);</code></pre>
<p>Here is what we get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Editor{text='Hello, world!', textSize=24, textColor=0x000000}
Editor{text='Hello, world!', textSize=12, textColor=0x000000}
Editor{text='', textSize=12, textColor=0x000000}</code></pre>
<p>All the changes are undone one by one!</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Memento is a behavioral pattern used to save the state of an object, preserving its encapsulation. Since direct access to the state would expose its implementation details, you can use it when you need to take a snapshot of the state of an object or a part of an object to restore that state later. The classic implementation of this pattern comprises three objects: the Originator whose state is saved, the Memento that stores the state, and the Caretaker that is responsible for saving the Memento but has no access to its internal state.<br/>Keeping many snapshots may require a significant amount of memory, but this problem can be avoided by limiting the number of simultaneously kept snapshots.</p>
