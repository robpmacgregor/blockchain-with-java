<p>Sometimes we need to have only a single instance of a class shared across an entire application. There is a special design pattern called <strong>Singleton</strong> that restricts the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3555" target="_blank" title="In Java, instantiation is the process of creating an object from a class blueprint. | This is done using the 'new' keyword followed by the class name, which allocates memory for the object and calls its constructor to initialize the object's state. Instantiated objects have their own identity and state, allowing them to interact with other objects and methods in the program. It's important to note that instantiation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, as it enables the creation of multiple instances of a class, each with its own unique characteristics and behavior.">instantiation</a> of a class to one object. The pattern ensures that there is only one instance of the class and provides global access to it for the outer world.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The same instance is used by different clients (classes, methods)</p>
<p>Singletons often control access to resources such as database connections or sockets.</p>
<p>For example, a class that keeps the connection to the database can be written as a singleton: creating a connection object time after time will be quite bulky in terms of memory. If it is a singleton, then your application will work better and faster.</p>
<p>Another example is a class that provides a universal logger for an application. It keeps the shared log-file as the resource.</p>
<p>In this topic, we will consider only the basic singleton implementation.</p>
<h5 id="basic-singleton-in-java" style="text-align: center;">Basic singleton in Java</h5>
<p>The standard way to write a class according to the singleton pattern includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a private constructor to defeat the creation of instances using the keyword <code class="language-java">new</code>;</li>
<li>a private static variable of the class that is the only instance of the class;</li>
<li>a public <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3555" target="_blank" title="In Java, a static method is a method that is associated with a class rather than an instance of a class. | It can be accessed directly using the class name and does not require the creation of a class instance. A static method can only access static fields and other static methods within the same class, and cannot refer to the `this` keyword because there is no instance context. Static methods are often used as utility methods that provide common functionality for the entire project. They can be called from instance methods, but not the other way around.">static method</a> to return the same instance of the class; this is a global access point to the instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following code implements these concepts:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Singleton {

    private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();

    private Singleton() { }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return INSTANCE;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>That class is quite simple, but let's take a closer look at it.</p>
<p>The class <code class="language-java">Singleton</code> is a basic implementation of the considered pattern. The field <code class="language-java">INSTANCE</code> stores only a single instance of the class. The constructor is declared as <code class="language-java">private</code> to defeat instantiation. The static method <code class="language-java">getInstance</code> returns the same instance of the class.</p>
<p>Let's create three variables, assign an instance to each of them and then compare the variables by references:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Singleton s1 = Singleton.getInstance();
Singleton s2 = Singleton.getInstance();
Singleton s3 = Singleton.getInstance();
        
System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true because s1 and s2 refer the same object
System.out.println(s2 == s3); // true because s2 and s3 refer the same object</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>As you can see, the variables <code class="language-java">s1</code><code class="language-java">s2</code>, and <code class="language-java">s3</code> refer the same object that is stored in the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3555" target="_blank" title="In Java, a static field is a field declared with the `static` keyword that is shared by all objects of a class, rather than belonging to an individual instance. | It can hold any primitive or reference type, and all instances of the class share the same value for a static field. Static fields are useful for storing global variables that all instances of a class should share, as they help save memory by not creating separate copies for each instance. However, it's typically not recommended to declare non-final public static fields, as they can be accessed and modified by any code that has access to the class. Additionally, it's important to note that static fields cannot access instance fields or methods, as there is no instance context.">static field</a> of <code class="language-java">Singleton</code>.</p>
<p>Usually, singletons have additional <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3555" target="_blank" title="In Java, an instance field is a field declared with the keyword instance variable that is associated with an object (instance) of a class, rather than the class itself. | It can hold any primitive or reference type, and each object of the class has its own unique instance field value, which can be different from other objects of the same class. Instance fields can be accessed within the class using the this keyword.

Class variables are often used for values that are shared across multiple instances of a class, such as mathematical constants or configuration settings.">global variables</a>) to share them across your application as well as methods to have a behavior.</p>
<h5 id="lazy-initialization" style="text-align: center;">Lazy initialization</h5>
<p>The singleton above loads the instance when the class is loaded. But sometimes the initialization of a singleton can take much time: for example, to load the values of the fields from a file or a database.</p>
<p>The following implementation loads the instance only if it is needed by a client (who calls <code class="language-java">getInstance</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Singleton {
    
    private static Singleton instance;
    
    private Singleton () { }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>Even though the implementation of a singleton pattern contains few lines of code, it has an important feature: <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3555" target="_blank" title="In Java, lazy initialization is a design pattern that delays the creation of an object or the execution of a method until it is actually needed. | This approach can be useful when the initialization process is time-consuming or resource-intensive, as it allows you to postpone the cost of initialization until the point of use. In the context of the provided text, lazy initialization is used in the implementation of a singleton pattern. The singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance throughout the application and provides a global point of access to it. By using lazy initialization, the singleton instance is not created until the method that returns the instance is called for the first time. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary initialization. It's important to note that lazy initialization can introduce thread-safety issues, especially in a multi-threaded environment.">lazy initialization</a>. It means that the singleton instance is not created until the <code class="language-java">getInstance</code> method is called for the first time. This technique ensures that singleton instances are created only when needed.</p>

<p>Popular frameworks for developing enterprise applications (such as Spring, Java EE) also use singletons.</p>
<h5 id="criticism" style="text-align: center;">Criticism</h5>
<p>Some criticize the singleton pattern and consider it to be an anti-pattern: it is frequently used where it is not beneficial, it imposes unnecessary restrictions in some situations and introduces global state into an application. Hence the wisdom: use the pattern wisely when you really need a singleton.</p>
